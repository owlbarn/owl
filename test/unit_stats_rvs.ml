    Consider the number of occurrence of trues/1's, particularly, within each run of M bools/bits.

    We can calculate Chi^2 = M*Sum( (Obs(1s)/M-p)^2/p ), summing over the N blocks.
    The inside of this is ((sum1s/M-0.5)^2)/0.5) = (sum1s/M-0.5)^2 = 2*chi2_obs (in the code)

    Assume that the probability of a 1 is 0.5, under the null hypothesis that 0s and 1s are equally likely.

    The probability of an observed value x2 for Chi^2 can be found from the Chi^2 distribution for N degrees of freedom.

  This ensures the pattern and block frequency tests reject the null hypothesis that a 'two zeros of four' distribution is independent with probability 0.5

  Since the frequency is 50% true, all the frequency and block frequency tests should fail to reject the null hypothesis

  Patterns of length 2 will be uniform, which is (unlikely!) but quite possible, so that should also fail to reject the null hypothesis

  Patterns of length 3 and above will have no matches for runs of three 0s or 1s, so should reject the null hypothesis
