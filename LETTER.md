# Owl - OCaml Scientific Computing (2016 - 2023)

Dear all,

Nearly eight years ago, we made our first commit to this repository, marking the beginning of a journey that has been both challenging and rewarding. Today, we've made the difficult decision to bring this project to a close. Reflecting on our time spent in the Computer Lab, we're filled with pride for what we've accomplished and gratitude for the support we've received from both organizations and individuals along the way.

This journey has been a significant part of our lives, and we hope that our work will continue to be a valuable resource for future researchers and practitioners in the fields of data analysis and functional programming. Despite our best efforts to find a financially viable path to sustain the development, we were unable to do so. Life has taken us, Liang and Jianxin, in new directionsâ€”moving to different countries, embarking on new career paths, and facing new challenges.

Making the decision to conclude this project wasn't easy, but it was a step we knew we would have to take eventually. As of today, we will no longer be providing maintenance or updates.

We want to express our deepest thanks to everyone who has been a part of this journey. Your support and encouragement have meant the world to us. Here's to the end of an era, and the beginning of whatever comes next.

With heartfelt appreciation,


Liang and Jianxin
