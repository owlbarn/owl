type model
(** Type of LDA model. *)

(** {5 Core functions} *)

val init : ?iter:int -> int -> Owl_nlp_corpus.t -> model
(**
[init ~iter k v d] inits an LDA model for training. The default iteration is
100.

Parameters:
  * [iter]: number of iterations.
  * [k]: number of topics.
  * [d]: corpus.
 *)

val train : lda_typ -> model -> unit
(** After calling [init], calling this function starts the training. *)

(** {5 Helper functions} *)

val show_info : model -> int -> float -> unit
(** Function for printing out log information, tailored for LDA training. *)

val include_token : model -> int -> int -> int -> unit
(** Include a token in model, used in training and you are not supposed to use it. *)

val exclude_token : model -> int -> int -> int -> unit
(** Exclude a token in model, used in training and you are not supposed to use it. *)
