val uniform : float -> float -> float
(** ``uniform a b`` returns a continuous RV uniformly distributed within [``a``, ``b``]. *)

val bernoulli : float -> float
(** ``bernoulli p`` returns a continuous RV equal to ``1.`` with probability ``p``, ``0.`` otherwise *)

val gaussian : float -> float -> float
(** ``gaussian mu sigma`` returns a continous RV normally distributed with mean ``mu`` and stddev ``sigma`` *)
