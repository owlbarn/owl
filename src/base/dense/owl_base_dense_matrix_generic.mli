About the comparison of two complex numbers ``x`` and ``y``, Owl uses the
following conventions: 1) ``x`` and ``y`` are equal iff both real and imaginary
parts are equal; 2) ``x`` is less than ``y`` if the magnitude of ``x`` is less than
the magnitude of ``x``; in case both ``x`` and ``y`` have the same magnitudes, ``x``
is less than ``x`` if the phase of ``x`` is less than the phase of ``y``; 3) less or
equal, greater, greater or equal relation can be further defined atop of the
aforementioned conventions.
