## Installation

Owl requires OCaml 4.04.0. The installation is rather trivial. First, you need to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ryanrhymes/owl.git
```

Then you need to install all the dependencies.

```bash
opam install ctypes dolog eigen gsl lacaml oasis plplot
```

Next, you can compile and install the module with the following command.

```bash
make oasis
make && make install
```

Owl is well integrated with `utop`. Now you can start `utop` and continue this tutorial to do some experiments. If you want `utop` to automatically load Owl for you, you can also edit `.ocamlinit` file in your home folder by adding the following lines. (Note that the library name is `owl` with lowercase `o`.)

```bash
#require "owl"
```

If you are too lazy to do any labour work, here is a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanrhymes/owl/) to let you try Owl without dealing with aforementioned installation and configuration steps. The docker image is automatically build from the master branch whenever there are new commits. You can check the building history on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanrhymes/owl/builds/).

Just pull the image, start a container, then play with it in `utop`. The latest source code is saved in `/root/owl` directory.

```bash
docker pull ryanrhymes/owl
docker run -t -i ryanrhymes/owl
```


## Access Modules

`Owl` currently has the following core modules and their names all start with `Owl_` to avoid name conflicts, e.g., `Owl_dense`, `Owl_sparse`, `Owl_maths`, `Owl_stats`, `Owl_const`, `Owl_fft`, `Owl_plot` and etc. After `utop` successfully loads `Owl` library, you can access the module functions using aforementioned names.

However, a more convenient way is to use `Owl` module as an entry point which provides aliases of the core module names for easy access, e.g., `Owl.Dense` is the same as `Owl_dense`, and `Owl.Regression` is the same as `Owl_regression`. Given no name conflicts, you can simply open the whole `Owl` module for convenience as I will do in the rest of this tutorial.

```ocaml
open Owl;;
```


## Create Matrices

[`Dense`](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/owl/Real.html) module supports dense matrix operations while [`Sparse`](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/owl/Sparse.html) module supports sparse ones. There are two submodules in `Dense`: `Real` module supports matrices of real numbers while `Complex` supports matrices of complex numbers. To start, we can use `Dense.Real.uniform_int` to create a 5x5 random dense matrix.

```ocaml
let x = Dense.Real.uniform_int 5 5;;
```

You should see the following output in `utop`.

```bash
   C0 C1 C2 C3 C4
R0 25  2 77 85 72
R1 71 92 98 87 53
R2 35 29 82 65 20
R3  2 29 66 42 12
R4 99 72 78 30 11
val x : Owl_dense_real.mat =
```

To save some typing efforts, we open the `Dense` module by default in `utop` for the following examples using `open Dense` so that we can access `Real` module directly. `Real` module also provides other functions to create various matrices, e.g., as below.

```ocaml
open Dense;;
let x = Real.eye 5;;             (* identity matrix *)
let x = Real.zeros 5 5;;         (* all elements are zeros *)
let x = Real.ones 5 5;;          (* all elements are ones *)
let x = Real.uniform 5 5;;       (* random matrix of uniform distribution *)
let x = Real.gaussian 5 5;;      (* random matrix of gaussian distribution *)
...
```

Combined with `Stats` module, you can also create any matrices of many distributions. E.g., the following code first creates an empty dense matrix, then initialise the elements with Bernoulli distribution. Test it in `utop`, you should get a dense matrix where half of the elements are zeros.

```ocaml
let x = Real.empty 8 8 |> Real.map (fun _ -> Stats.Rnd.bernoulli 0.5 |> float_of_int);;
```

Or create a matrix where the elements follow Laplace distribution.

```ocaml
let x = Real.empty 8 8 |> Real.map (fun _ -> Stats.Rnd.laplace 0.2);;
```

With `Dense` module, you can also generate linearly spaced interval and meshgrids, e.g.,

```ocaml
let x = Real.linspace 0. 5. 6;;
```
which will return a 1x5 row vector as below
```bash
   C0  C1  C2  C3  C4  C5
R0  0   1   2   3   4   5
val x : Owl_dense_real.mat =
```

Matrices can be saved to and loaded from a file.

```ocaml
Real.save x 'matrix_01.data';;  (* save the matrix to a file *)
Real.load 'matrix_01.data';;    (* load the matrix from a file *)
```


## Access Elements, Rows, and Columns

Both `Dense` and `Sparse` modules provide a wide range of operations to access the elements, rows, and columns of a matrix. You can use `Real.set` and `Real.get` to manipulate individual element.

```ocaml
Real.set x 0 1 2.5;;
Real.get x 0 1;;
```

Equivalently, there are shorthands for `Real.get` and `Real.set`.

```ocaml
x.{0,1} <- 2.5;;  (* Real.set x 0 1 2.5 *)
x.{0,1};;         (* Real.get x 0 1 *)
```

We can use `Real.row` and `Real.col` to retrieve a specific row or column of a matrix, or use `Real.rows` and `Real.cols` to retrieve multiple of them.

```ocaml
Real.row x 5;;        (* retrieve the fifth row *)
Real.cols x [|1;3;2|] (* retrieve the column 1, 3, and 2 *)
```

E.g., the following code generates a random matrix, then scales up each element by a factor of 10 using `Real.map` function.

```ocaml
let x = Real.(uniform 6 6 |> map (fun x -> x *. 10.));;
```

We can iterate a matrix row by row, or column by column. The following code calculates the sum of each row by calling `Real.map_rows` function.

```ocaml
let x = Real.(uniform 6 6 |> map_rows sum);;
```

We can fold elements by calling `Real.fold`, fold rows by calling `Real.fold_rows`. Similarly, there are also functions for `filter` operations. The following code filters out the elements not greater than 0.1 in x.

```ocaml
Real.filter ((>) 0.1) x;;    (* not greater than 0.1 in x *)
```

We can also do something more complicated, e.g., by filtering out the rows whose summation is greater than 3.

```ocaml
Real.filter_rows (fun r -> Real.sum r > 3.) x;;
```

Shuffle the rows and columns, or draw some of them from a matrix.

```ocaml
Real.shuffle_rows x;;                (* shuffle the rows in x *)
Real.draw_cols x 3;;                 (* draw 3 columns from x with replacement *)
...
```

Practically, `Sparse` module provides all the similar operations for sparse matrices. In addition, `Sparse` module also has extra functions such as only iterating non-zero elements `Sparse.iter_nz`, and etc. Please read the full documentation for details.


## Linear Algebra

Simple matrix mathematics like add, sub, multiplication, and division are included in `Dense` module. Moreover, there are predefined shorthands for such operations. E.g., the following code creates two random matrices then compare which is greater.

```ocaml
let x = Real.uniform 6 6;;
let y = Real.uniform 6 6;;
Real.(x >@ y)                  (* is x greater than y? *)
Real.(x =@ y)                  (* is x equal to y? *)
...
```

Some basic math operations includes:

```ocaml
Real.(x +@ y)                  (* add two matrices *)
Real.(x *@ y)                  (* multiply two matrices, element-wise *)
Real.(x $@ y)                  (* dot product of two matrices *)
Real.(x +$ 2.)                 (* add a scalar to all elements in x *)
...
```

Apply various functions in `Maths` module to every element in x

```ocaml
Real.(Maths.sin @@ x);;        (* apply sine function *)
Real.(Maths.exp @@ x);;        (* apply exponential function *)
...
```

Concatenate two matrices, vertically or horizontally by

```ocaml
Real.(x @= y);;                (* equivalent to Real.concat_vertical *)
Real.(x @|| y);;               (* equivalent to Real.concat_horizontal *)
```

More advanced linear algebra operations such as `svd`, `qr`, and `cholesky` decomposition are included in `Linalg` module.

```ocaml
let u,s,v = Linalg.svd x   (* singular value decomposition *)
let q,r = Linalg.qr x      (* QR decomposition *)
let l = Linalg.cholesky x  (* cholesky decomposition *)
...
```


## Regression

`Regression` module currently includes `linear`, `exponential`, `nonlinear`, `ols`, `ridge`, `lasso`, `svm`, and etc. Most of them are based on a stochastic gradient descent algorithm implemented in `Optimise` module.

In the following, let's use an example to illustrate the simplest linear regression in `Regression` module. First, let's generate the measurement x which is a 1000 x 3 matrix. Each row of x is an independent measurement.

```ocaml
let x = Real.uniform 1000 3;;
```

Next let's define the parameter of a linear model, namely p, a 3 x 1 matrix.

```ocaml
let p = Real.of_array [|0.2;0.4;0.8|] 3 1;;
```

Then we generate the observations y from x and p by

```ocaml
let y = Real.(x $@ p);;
```

Now, assume we only know x and y, how can we fit x and y into a linear model? It is very simple.

```ocaml
let p' = Regression.linear x y;;
```

From `utop`, you can see that p' equals `[|0.2; 0.4; 0.8|]` which is exactly the same as p. For other regression such as `lasso` and `svm`, the operation is more or less the same, please read Owl document for details.


## Plotting

There is another separate [Tutorial on Plotting in Owl](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/wiki/Tutorial:-How-to-Plot-in-Owl%3F).
Herein, let's use an example to briefly show how to plot the result using `Plot` module. We first generate two mesh grids then apply sine function to them by using the operations introduced before.

```ocaml
let x, y = Real.meshgrid (-2.5) 2.5 (-2.5) 2.5 100 100 in
let z = Real.(Maths.sin @@ ((x **@ 2.) +@ (y **@ 2.))) in
Plot.mesh x y z;;
```

No matter what plot terminal you use, you should end up with a figure as below.

![Plot example 01](examples/test_plot_01.png)

Besides `Plot.mesh`, there are several other basic plotting functions in `Plot`. Even though the module is still immature and under active development, it can already do some fairly complicated plots with minimal coding efforts. E.g., the following code will generate a `2 x 2` subplot.

```ocaml
let f p i = match i with
  | 0 -> Stats.Rnd.gaussian ~sigma:0.5 () +. p.(1)
  | _ -> Stats.Rnd.gaussian ~sigma:0.1 () *. p.(0)
in
let y = Stats.gibbs_sampling f [|0.1;0.1|] 5_000 |> Real.of_arrays in
let h = Plot.create ~m:2 ~n:2 "test_plot_04.png" in
let _ = Plot.set_background_color h 255 255 255 in
let _ = Plot.subplot h 0 0 in
let _ = Plot.set_title h "Bivariate model" in
let _ = Plot.scatter ~h (Real.col y 0) (Real.col y 1) in
let _ = Plot.subplot h 0 1 in
let _ = Plot.set_title h "Distribution of y" in
let _ = Plot.set_xlabel h "y" in
let _ = Plot.set_ylabel h "Frequency" in
let _ = Plot.histogram ~h ~bin:50 (Real.col y 1) in
let _ = Plot.subplot h 1 0 in
let _ = Plot.set_title h "Distribution of x" in
let _ = Plot.set_ylabel h "Frequency" in
let _ = Plot.histogram ~h ~bin:50 (Real.col y 0) in
let _ = Plot.subplot h 1 1 in
let _ = Plot.set_foreground_color h 51  102 255 in
let _ = Plot.set_title h "Sine function" in
let _ = Plot.plot_fun ~h ~line_style:2 Maths.sin 0. 28. in
let _ = Plot.autocorr ~h (Real.sequential 1 28) in
Plot.output h;;
```

The end result is as follows. You probably have already grasped the idea of how to plot in Owl. But I promise to write another separate post to introduce plotting in more details.

## Maths and Stats

There are a lot of basic and advanced mathematical and statistical functions in `Maths` and `Stats` modules. Most of them are interfaced to Gsl directly, so you may want to read [GSL Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/) carefully before using the module.

[`Stats`](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/owl/Stats.html) has three submodules: [`Stats.Rnd`](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/owl/Stats.Rnd.html) for random numbers, [`Stats.Pdf`](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/owl/Stats.Pdf.html) for probability dense functions, and [`Stats.Cdf`](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/owl/Stats.Cdf.html) for cumulative distribution functions. In addition, I have implemented extra functions such as two ranking correlations: `Stats.kendall_tau` and `Stats.spearman_rho`); two MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) functions in `Stats` module: Metropolis-Hastings (`Stats.metropolis_hastings`) and Gibbs sampling (`Stats.gibbs_sampling`) algorithms.

E.g., the following code first defines a probability density function `f` for a mixture Gaussian model. Then we use `Stats.metropolis_hastings` to draw 100_000 samples based on the given pdf `f`, and the initial point is `0.1`. In the end, we call `Plot.histogram` to plot the distribution of the samples, from which we can clearly see they are from a mixture Gaussian model.

```ocaml
let f p = Stats.Pdf.((gaussian p.(0) 0.5) +. (gaussian (p.(0) -. 3.5) 1.)) in
let y = Stats.metropolis_hastings f [|0.1|] 100_000 |>  Real.of_arrays in
Plot.histogram ~bin:100 y;;
```

The histogram below shows the distribution of the samples.

![Plot example 02](examples/test_plot_02.png)

Here is another example using `Stats.gibbs_sampling` to sample a bivariate distribution. Gibbs sampling requires the full conditional probability function so we defined its corresponding random number generator in `f p i` where `p` is the parameter vector and `i` indicates which parameter to sample.

```ocaml
let f p i = match i with
  | 0 -> Stats.Rnd.gaussian ~sigma:0.5 () +. p.(1)
  | _ -> Stats.Rnd.gaussian ~sigma:0.1 () *. p.(0)
in
let y = Stats.gibbs_sampling f [|0.1;0.1|] 5_000 |> Real.of_arrays in
Plot.scatter (Real.col y 0) (Real.col y 1);;
```

We take 5000 samples from the defined distribution and plot them as a scatter plot, as below.

![Plot example 03](examples/test_plot_03.png)

The future plan is to embed a small PPL (Probabilistic Programming Language) in `Stats` module.


## N-dimensional Array

Owl has a very powerful module to manipulate dense N-dimensional arrays, i.e., `Dense.Ndarray`. Ndarray is very similar to the corresponding modules in Numpy and Julia. For sparse N-dimensional arrays, you can use `Sparse.Ndarray` which provides a similar set of APIs as aforementioned Ndarray. Here is an [initial evaluation](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/wiki/Evaluation:-Performance-Test) on the performance of Ndarray.

In the following, I will present a couple of examples using Ndarray module. First, we can create empty ndarrays of shape `[|3;4;5|]`. Owl supports four types of ndarrays: `Float32`, `Float64`, `Complex32`, and `Complex64`.

```ocaml
let x0 = Dense.Ndarray.empty Bigarray.Float32 [|3;4;5|];;
let x1 = Dense.Ndarray.empty Bigarray.Float64 [|3;4;5|];;
let x2 = Dense.Ndarray.empty Bigarray.Complex32 [|3;4;5|];;
let x3 = Dense.Ndarray.empty Bigarray.Complex64 [|3;4;5|];;
```

You can also assign the initial values to the elements, generate a zero/one ndarray, or even a random ndarray.

```ocaml
Dense.Ndarray.zeros Bigarray.Complex32 [|3;4;5|];;
Dense.Ndarray.ones Bigarray.Float64 [|3;4;5|];;
Dense.Ndarray.create Bigarray.Float32 [|3;4;5|] 1.5;;
Dense.Ndarray.create Bigarray.Complex32 [|3;4;5|] Complex.({im=1.5; re=2.5});;
Dense.Ndarray.uniform Bigarray.Float64 [|3;4;5|];;
```

With these created ndarray, you can do some math operation as below.

```ocaml
let x = Dense.Ndarray.uniform Bigarray.Float64 [|3;4;5|];;
let y = Dense.Ndarray.uniform Bigarray.Float64 [|3;4;5|];;
let z = Dense.Ndarray.add x y;;
Dense.Ndarray.print z;;
```

Owl supports many math operations and these operations have been well vectorised so they are very fast.

```ocaml
Dense.Ndarray.sin x;;
Dense.Ndarray.tan x;;
Dense.Ndarray.exp x;;
Dense.Ndarray.log x;;
Dense.Ndarray.min x;;
Dense.Ndarray.add_scalar x 2.;;
Dense.Ndarray.mul_scalar x 2.;;
...
```

Examining elements and comparing two ndarrays are also very easy.

```ocaml
Dense.Ndarray.is_zero x;;
Dense.Ndarray.is_positive x;;
Dense.Ndarray.is_nonnegative x;;
...
Dense.Ndarray.is_equal x y;;
Dense.Ndarray.is_greater x y;;
Dense.Ndarray.equal_or_smaller x y;;
...
```

You can certainly plugin your own functions to check each elements.

```ocaml
Dense.Ndarray.exists ((>) 2.) x;;
Dense.Ndarray.not_exists ((<) 2.) x;;
Dense.Ndarray.for_all ((=) 2.) x;;
```

Most importantly, you can use Owl to iterate a ndarray in various ways. Owl provides a simple but flexible and powerful way to define a "slice" in ndarray. Comparing to the "`Bigarray.slice_left`" function, the slice in Owl does not have to start from the left-most axis. E.g., for the previously defined `[|3;4;5|]` ndarray, you can define a slice in the following ways:

```ocaml
let s0 = [|None; None; None|]      (* (*,*,*), essentially the whole ndarray as one slice *)
let s1 = [|Some 0; None; None|]    (* (0,*,*) *)
let s2 = [|None; Some 2; None|]    (* (*,2,*) *)
let s3 = [|None; None; Some 1|]    (* (*,*,1) *)
let s4 = [|Some 1; None; Some 2|]  (* (1,*,2) *)
...
```

With the slice definition above, we can iterate and map the elements in a slice. E.g., we add one to all the elements in slice `(0,*,*)`.

```ocaml
Dense.Ndarray.map ~axis:[|Some 0; None; None|] (fun a -> a +. 1.) x;;
```

There are more functions to help you to iterate elements and slices in a ndarray: `iteri`, `iter`, `mapi`, `map`, `filteri`, `filter`, `foldi`, `fold`, `iteri_slice`, `iter_slice`, `iter2i`, `iter2`. Please refer to the documentation for their details.


## Run Owl on Different Platforms

If you want to try Owl on ARM based platforms such as Raspberry Pi rather than x86 ones, the installation are similar. Just note that Owl requires Ocaml 4.04, which might not be supported on your platform's binary distribution system yet, so you might consider compiling [Ocaml sources](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.04.html). Besides, to solve a potential conflict with gsl package, after running `./configure` in the top directory, you should run:
```
sed -i -e 's/#define ARCH_ALIGN_DOUBLE/#undef ARCH_ALIGN_DOUBLE/g' config/m.h config/m-templ.h
```
before running `make world.opt`.

 A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixanger/owl/) is also provided on Docker Hub specifically for ARM platform. Just pull the image, start a container, then play with it in `utop`.

```
docker run --name owl -it matrixanger/owl:arm
```

Note that after starting a new container you need to run
```
eval `opam config env`
```
for once before starting `utop`.


## How To Contribute

Owl is under active development, and I really look forward to your comments and contributions. Besides setting up a complete development environment on your native system, the easiest way to contribute is to use the [Owl Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanrhymes/owl/). Moreover, we have also built a docker image for ARM-based platform so that you can run Owl on Raspberry PI and Cubietruck (see the section above).

Just pull the image and dig into code saved in `/root/owl`, then have fun!
